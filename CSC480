CSC480 Senior Project 

 

 

What have you done personally since your last progress report?

I have created multiple pages and code of the 15 recipes for France, Italy, and Turkey. I have also created a comment page for chiefs and cooks to leave comments or concerns about the recipes. 

Describe any significant progress made by the team as a whole in this time period.

We as a team are coming very close to finishing. We have set specific deadlines to have our Senior Project completed
