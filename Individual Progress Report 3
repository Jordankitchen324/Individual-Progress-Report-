1. What have you done personally since your last progress report?
I have complete all of my recipes italian, French, and Turkish for the project and as a group we have linked them all together with the home page. 

2. Describe any significant progress made by the team as a whole in this time period.
Like i previouslsy stated we as a group have linked the recipes together and now we are trying to link the database with the website.
